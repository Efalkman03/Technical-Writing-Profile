                         and diversity, and project sustainability. This proposal was successful because of

                      Introduction
                      The Children’s Hospital has an online resource titled “Clinical A-Z Library: Patient & Family Education Materials” (Children’s Minnesota, 2022). Many families rely on Children’s hospitals for their children’s health. Therefore, these patient education materials must include technical writing elements that properly serve their audience.
                      Methods
                      Google Form surveying was used to gather primary data on this matter. After the primary research was gathered, four peer-reviewed sources were gathered from the UMN Library Database to support the primary research.
                      Results
                      The Children’s patient education materials lack several essential technical writing elements. Children’s Minnesota currently uses high-level terminology, a partial lack of pictorial diagrams, and noninteractive content in its educational materials. Due to the small sample size of respondents in the survey and interview, both of the empirical sources are not entirely representative of the healthcare system participants. Additionally, it is important to note that the Children’s Hospital's technical writing procedures are unknown. 
                      Conclusion and Recommendations
                      Children’s Minnesota could improve its patient education materials with PEMAT usability testing, less text, more sixth-grade-level terminology, more pictures, and more videos. Secondary sources demonstrate what these elements are and why they are essential. " />

                      <p>In this <b>formal report</b>, the language and visuals of <b>Children's Hospital patient education 
                        materials</b> were analyzed. Primary and secondary <b>research</b> was conducted to thoroughly analyze whether
                        the technical writing elements were constructive. <b>Recommendations</b> were provided based on this research.

                      <h2>Technical Description</h2>
                      <a href="../Documents/Parts of a Stethoscope.png">
                      <img src="../Documents/Parts of a Stethoscope.png" width="400px" alt="Parts of a Stethoscope: Parts of a Stethoscope
                      Chestpiece
                      The chestpiece is the part of the stethoscope that is pressed against the patient's body. It detects and transfers internal sounds to the headset through the tubing. The chestpiece works best when it is pressed directly against the patient's skin. This works best because there are fewer factors that can disrupt the internal sound transfer. The chestpiece consists of three different parts: 
                      Tunable diaphragm
                      Bell
                      Stem
                      Tunable Diaphragm
                      One aspect of a stethoscope is detecting various internal sounds. This process uses the tunable diaphragm and the bell. The tunable diaphragm is the large, circular end of the chestpiece. Tunable diaphragms can detect sounds with high frequencies in the patient's body because of their large size. Higher frequency sounds occur when a patient is breathing. The small circular end of the chestpiece is the bell. This part can detect lower-frequency sounds because of its smaller size. An example of a low-frequency, internal sound is blood going through vessels. When medical professionals can hear both low and high-frequency sounds, they can better assess the patient's needs. 
                      Another aspect of a stethoscope is transferring sounds from the patient to the medical professional’s ears. This process uses the stem and the tubing. The stem is the stethoscope part that connects the chestpiece and the tubing. It ensures that the sounds reach the tubing exceptionally well. Additionally, it allows one to switch between the bell and the tunable diaphragm. Tubing is the stethoscope part that connects the chestpiece to the headset. It ensures that the internal body sounds are transferred securely. 
                      Headset
                      The other half of the stethoscope is called the headset. It consists of ear tips and ear tubes. The ear tips are the parts that go in the medical professional's ears. Ear tubes are metal tubes that have long tubing in the middle to the ear tips. They are usually made of rubber or silicone." />

                      <p><b>Parts of a Stethoscope</b> is an <b>informative article</b> that describes the components of a stethoscope.
                         Unpracticed medical students may be unaware of each compenent and how it contributes to the stethescope's function. 
                         Written instructions allow the medical students to <b>revisit important terminology when using a stethoscope</b>.</p>

                        Look for a link or button that says Use another account or Sign in to activate (or a similar message).

                        Sign out from Microsoft Office 365. 
                        Sign in again.
