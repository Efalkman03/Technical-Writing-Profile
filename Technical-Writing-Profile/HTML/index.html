          What is Technical Writing?
        </h2>
        <p>
          <b>Technical writing</b> in the context of <b>public health</b> involves the <b>creation</b> of documents, reports, 
          manuals, grant proposals, and guidelines. In general, technical writers <b>simplify, arrange, and 
          document</b> complex public health information. We often <b>appeal</b> to healthcare professionals, policy 
          makers, researchers, and the general public. If you have any questions about technical writing,
