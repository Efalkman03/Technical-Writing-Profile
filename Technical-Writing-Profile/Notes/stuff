Portfolio code for sections needs to be fixed

Sample portfolio: https://www.straygoat.co.uk/portfolio-technical-writer

Things to ask about:

- Is there a better way to adjust my flex properties for my hero?
- Is there an issue with the way I am coding my columns?
- This may have a complicated answer, but how do I make this website work better for mobile viewers? Is there a source you know that could help me with that?
- How do I change the link from index.html to a url that is more widely available on the internet?
- Do you have any overall suggestions for my website?
